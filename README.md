# Lead-Score-Prediction
Lead Score Prediction Model for Sales and Marketing Optimization

The primary objective of this project is to develop a logistic regression model that can accurately predict the likelihood of lead conversion, and assign a lead score ranging from 0 to 100 to each of the leads. This will enable the company to identify potential customers who are most likely to purchase courses and prioritize leads accordingly, ultimately increasing the conversion rate. In addition to lead scores, a categorical column named "Lead Quality" has been created, which categorizes leads into "Hot," "Potential," and "Cold" based on their probability of conversion. The main aim of this project is to enhance the efficiency of the sales and marketing team by enabling them to focus their efforts on leads that have the highest potential for conversion, ultimately resulting in increased revenue for the company.
